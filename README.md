# Exercise

## Your task

Your task is to create a registration form for Angular 9 + NestJS application. We estimate this will take 3-4 hours for a person who is familiar with the technology stack. The stack is the same that you would be using in your work.

- Add a registration screen to an existing Angular application skeleton

- Server-side entity and validation for the registration data using NestJS backend

- PostgreSQL migrations for all of the above
  - Must be applied on the existing database with existing records,
    so understand this when designing null keys and unique value constrains

- End-to-end tests that exercises both frontend and backend
  - Registration succeeded test
  - Registration failed test

- Pull request which will be reviewed
  - Contains screenshots detailing the changes
  - Contains migration instructions
  - Contains instructions for an internal QA team how to manually test the application,
    assuming they can run the application locally on their PC
